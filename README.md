This is the official implementation of 

["Provable Adversarial Robustness for Group Equivariant Tasks: Graphs, Point clouds, Molecules, and More"](https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/hash/00db17c36b5435195760520efa96d99c-Abstract-Conference.html)

## Requirements
To install the requirements, execute
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

You also need to download reference implementations of different geometric machine learning models and certificates, which we extend.
They can be downloaded to the `reference_implementations` folder via
```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```
You then need to install each of the packages in the `reference_implementations` folder.
This can usually be done via `pip install -e .` and/or `conda install --name equivariance_robustness --file [...].yml`. Consult their respective readmes.

To train molecular force prediction models via the code in `reference_implementations/uncertainty_molecules`, you will additionally need to create and configure a [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai) account.


## Installation
You can install this package via `pip install -e .`

## Data
The graph datasets (TUDataset and Planetoid) are downloaded automatically via pytorch geometric.  
The molecule dataset (MD17) is also downloaded automatically via pytorch geometric.  
For the ModelNet40 dataset, download the original and pre-processed files linked in the [Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch repository](https://github.com/yanx27/Pointnet_Pointnet2_pytorch).

## Usage
In order to reproduce all experiments, you will need need to execute the scripts in `seml/scripts` using the config files provided in `seml/configs`.  
We use the [SLURM Experiment Management Library](https://github.com/TUM-DAML/seml), but the scripts are just standard sacred experiments that can also be run without a MongoDB and SLURM installation.  

After computing all certificates, you can use the notebooks in `plotting` to recreate the figures from the paper.  
In case you do not want to run all experiments yourself, you can just run the notebooks while keeping the flag `overwrite=False` (our results are then loaded from the respective `raw_data` files).

For more details on which config files and plotting notebooks to use for recreating which figure from the paper, please consult [REPROCE.MD](./REPRODUCE.md).
